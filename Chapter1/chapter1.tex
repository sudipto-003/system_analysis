\subsection{DTH service in context of Bangladesh}
In Bangladesh, almost every home has a television. For some people, watching television is their sole source of amusement.
Television has risen to become the most powerful medium on the planet. The number of people who possess a television and the number of people who watch it is growing every day. Bangladeshi audiences have been affected by the worldwide trend.

The television attracts Bangladeshis. According to a 2010 study, 46 \% of households own a television, with 76 \% of urban people owning one and 32 \% of rural dwellers owning one.
When compared to numbers from a 1995 media poll, it is clear that the ownership rate has risen significantly in the last fourteen years. Over this time, overall TV ownership has increased by about six times, from 8 \% to 46 \%, and it has increased by seven times in rural regions, from 3 \% to 32 \%. In 2010, 83 \% of urban homes had access to television. People are also growing more knowledgeable about new technologies. They expect more and better from the services they are receiving. Cable networks are not available or are very inadequate in rural and remote areas, as well as on the outskirts of several cities. DTH service was a must for them.Another important reason is that because DTH receives signals straight from the satellite, it assures digital quality picture and stereo sound. Cable TV, on the other hand, suffers from signal loss, resulting in poor picture quality. In our neighboring nations, such as India and Pakistan, DTH service is already highly popular. DTH service was first deployed in India in 2003. As a result, it was past time for Bangladeshis to have access to this type of service that would enhance their television viewing experience.
\subsection{What is DTH service}
Direct to Home (DTH) also known as Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS) is a method of receiving satellite television by means of signals transmitted from direct broadcast satellite. All the major services including DirecTV, Dish Network, Bell TV, Shaw Direct, and Sky use direct-broadcast satellites. DTH service ensures high picture quality and stereo sound as the signals are transmitted using Ku band.
Before DTH service was introduced signals were sent from fixed service satellites on the C band analog and received with only systems, which had more disadvantages to DTH service including the requirement of large satellite dishes and cable infrastructure. Moreover, it is not possible to reach everywhere with cable. In remote areas like hill tracks cable network is unavailable or very poor. For most of them TV is the only source of entertainment. They need better entertainment in their life which DTH service can fulfill. Whereas Cable TV is through cable networks, DTH service is wireless. Consumers can enjoy this service through a personal dish and a set-top box. DTH service is already popular in our neighboring countries. It has more advantages to cable network .In cable network after receiving the signal the signal is distributed through cable which causes signal loss. The more the distance the more signal loss occurs, thus the picture quality is compromised.
\subsection{How does AKASH DTH service work}
DTH stands for Direct to Home; as the name says, consumers will receive a signal directly from the satellite through the dish installed at their premise. In order to access the AKASH service, users will need a set top box, dish and other equipment as recommended by the company.
