\subsection{What is DTH service}
Direct to Home (DTH) also known as Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS) is a method of receiving satellite television by means of signals transmitted from direct broadcast satellite. All the major services including DirecTV, Dish Network, Bell TV, Shaw Direct, and Sky use direct-broadcast satellites. DTH service ensures high picture quality and stereo sound as the signals are transmitted using Ku band.
Before DTH service was introduced signals were sent from fixed service satellites on the C band analog and received with only systems, which had more disadvantages to DTH service including the requirement of large satellite dishes and cable infrastructure. Moreover, it is not possible to reach everywhere with cable. In remote areas like hill tracks cable network is unavailable or very poor. For most of them TV is the only source of entertainment. They need better entertainment in their life which DTH service can fulfill. Whereas Cable TV is through cable networks, DTH service is wireless. Consumers can enjoy this service through a personal dish and a set-top box. DTH service is already popular in our neighboring countries. It has more advantages to cable network .In cable network after receiving the signal the signal is distributed through cable which causes signal loss. The more the distance the more signal loss occurs, thus the picture quality is compromised.
\subsection{How does AKASH DTH service work}
DTH stands for Direct to Home; as the name says, consumers will receive a signal directly from the satellite through the dish installed at their premise. In order to access the AKASH service, users will need a set top box, dish and other equipment as recommended by the company.
