\section{Introduction}
AKASH DTH has been providing direct to home service across the country. They brought this service first ever in Bangladesh with an aim to win the hearts of millions with its commitment to quality services that will revolutionize the entertainment industry in the country.
\newline
As AKASH DTH looks forward to take the nationwide tv viewing experience to next level and be the leader among the tv service provider in Bangladesh; so customer satisfaction should be very important thing. An user friendly system can deliver best customer satisfaction. User problems and needs should be identified and solved. Some of problems are identified here initially and we recommend some solutions. The company should take proper steps based on these suggestions.

\section{Initial Feasibility Study}
An initial feasibility study means the test of a system proposal according to its impact on the organization, work ability, ability to meet user needs and effective use of existing resources. The objective of the feasibility study is not to solve the problem. It creates a sense of its scope and resultant a formal proposal.
\subsection{Feasibility Study of the Problems}
\subparagraph{1. statement of the problem}
As the service is satellite based so bad weather occurs transmission problem. In time of rain or most cloudy weather dish co not catch the signal properly and users may not be able to watch the TV coverage properly.
\subparagraph{Summary of Findings}
company should provide good transponders installed and to check that there are no joints between connection cables.
\subparagraph{Details of Findings}
There can be many reasons for signal problem. Besides bad weather, there could be many reasons for bad reception and some include wire disturbances, wrong choice of transponder etc. These bad signal issues hamper picture quality and consumers deprive of good watching experience from their television. So, this problem should take seriously.
\subparagraph{Recommendations and Conclusions}
When the installation process is being carried out, they have to make sure that the transponders get maximum signals. During installation, the signal strength of each of these transponders must be checked properly.

\subparagraph{2. statement of the problem}
In context of Bangladeshi user pricing is very important factor. The monthly charge seems overpriced to the consumer.
\subparagraph{Summary of Findings}
the company should look even better on the pricing to attract more consumer and satisfy their present customer.
\subparagraph{Details of Findings}
Most of the Bangladeshi consumers are price sensitive in any field. The regular cable connections are less costly. DTH service installation cost and monthly cost are overpriced to customers. Which we get from our initial finding.
\subparagraph{Recommendations and Conclusions}
So, company should reduce their price promoting attractive packages and attract more consumers.

\subparagraph{3. statement of the problem}
Akash DTH is offering 120 channels in their standard package. But there are lack of some popular channels.
\subparagraph{Details of Findings}

\subparagraph{Recommendations and Conclusions}

\subparagraph{4. statement of the problem}

\subparagraph{Details of Findings}
As we know, to consume DTH service a set top box is needed in consumers home; the set top box contains a remote to control the channels. Remote is frequently used and easy to damaged. But the remote is unique for one device. Consumer have to buy whole set top box if they lost of damaged their remote. It is as costly as bothering to user end.
\subparagraph{Recommendations and Conclusions}
We recommend company should provide multiple remote for one set top box. This can solve user bothering if they damage or lost their remote.
